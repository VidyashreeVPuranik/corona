  <h3>
    There have been several myths around the disease, like consuming
    more garlic, curry leaves or cow’s urine would treat or protect one from
    the disease.
    The World Health Organisation has busted such misleading claims. On
    garlic, WHO said it is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial
    properties but there is no evidence that it has prevented people from
    contracting the 2019 nCoV.</h3>
    <h3>
    Here are some other myths and the WHO’s response to
    them:</h3>

    <div>
    <h2>
    Myth: “COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid
    climates”</h2>
    <p>
    From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in
    ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless
    of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area
    reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-
    19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate
    viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur
    by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.</p></div>


    <div>
    <h2>
    Myth: The new coronavirus can be transmitted through mosquito bites.</h2>
    <p>
    To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the
    new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new
    coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through
    droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or
    through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect
    yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub
    or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with
    anyone who is coughing and sneezing.</p></div>
