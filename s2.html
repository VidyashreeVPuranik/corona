    <h1>Some common queries answered</h1>
        <div>
    <h2>  Are there differences between symptoms caused by the
      flu and COVID-19?</h2>
<p>
    Cough and cold could mean an allergy. A fever with cough and cold is
    a symptom of the flu. When you have fever with a cough which is
    complicated by breathlessness, it is a symptom of Coronavirus
    infection and you must call your doctor to rule it out.
    </p>

    <div>
     <h2>  How effective are thermal scanners in detecting
      people infected with the new coronavirus?</h2>
      <p>

    Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed
    a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of
    infection with the new coronavirus. However, they cannot detect
    people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because
    it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become
    sick and develop a fever.  </p>  </div>

    <div>
        <h2>  Can a person exposed to Coronavirus transmit it to
          others if he/she uses a swimming pool?</h2>
<p>
    Highly unlikely. The Coronavirus is a droplet infection. It has to be
    inhaled to cause the disease. Chlorination of swimming pools to
    recommended levels can certainly inactivate any virus, including
    COVID-19.</p>
    </div>


    <div>
<h2>Should people avoid eating meat-based food to
prevent transmission?</h2>
<p>

    It is a respiratory virus and not a food-borne one. Coronavirus has
    nothing to do with food or pet animals or eating chicken and mutton.
    People can eat whatever they want and how much ever they want.
    </p></div>

    <div>
    <h2>  Is there a link between a person’s immunity and
      COVID-19 transmission?</h2>
    <p>
    Coronovirus is one of the weakest family of viruses. The deaths caused
    so far or people affected could have been ones with less immunity like
    children or the elderly. Sometimes, the virus enters a person’s lungs
    and causes pneumonia. People with vulnerable immunity like the
    elderly succumb to this. For young people with good immunity, the
    effects of the virus may not be too strong but if you are someone with
    comorbid conditions like diabetes or cardiac disease, or if you are on
    immunosuppresive drugs, then the risk of infection is severe.
      </p></div>

      <div>
      <h2>  Are there any home remedies to treat COVID-19?</h2>
    <p>
    Home remedies and treatment other than allopathy is not proven
    science. The best thing is precaution only. You must keep away from a
    patient who coughs and sneezes. If you are coughing, you need to cover
    your face with a mask and not spread the droplets around. COVID-19
    spreads through droplets.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h2>  Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the
      new coronavirus?</h2>
    <p>
    No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new
    coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should
    not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.
    However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive
    antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.
    </p>  </div>

    <div>
       <h2>  Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the
        new coronavirus?</h2>
      <p>
    No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and
    Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection
    against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and different that it
    needs its own vaccine.
    Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV,
    vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to
    protect your health.
