  <h3>
Official names have been announced for the virus responsible for COVID-19 (previously known as “2019 novel coronavirus”) and the disease it causes.</h3></div>
<div> <p> The official names are:</p></div>
<div>
  <h3>
Disease-coronavirus disease(COVID-19)</h3></div>

<div>
<h3>Virus-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)</h3></div>





      <h2>So How Did It All Start?</h2>
<p>
        On December 31, 2019, China informed the World Health Organization of a
  cluster of cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause in Wuhan City in Hubei
  province. On January 9, 2020, the WHO issued a statement saying Chinese
  researchers have made “preliminary determination” of the virus as a novel
  coronavirus.
</p>
<div>
<h2>Understanding the disease</h2>
<p>
The
World Health Organisation has declared COVID-19 to be a
pandemic . The symptoms of COVID-19 appear within two to 14 days
after exposure and include fever, cough, a runny nose and difficulty in
breathing.
</p>


</div>
      <h2>What Are Corona-Viruses?</h2>
<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less
severe common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS).

<div>
    <h2>Structure of the SARS-CoV-2</h2>
    <p>Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 virus particles are spherical
and have mushroom-shaped proteins called spikes protruding from
their surface, giving the particles a crown-like appearance. The spike
binds and fuses to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Why is the Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 important ?</h2>
  <p>Mapping the 3D structure of the protein — spike (S) glycoprotein —
will allow better understanding of how the virus binds to the human
cells. Knowing the structure of the spike protein will, in turn, allow
scientists to develop vaccines and antivirals against the virus and even
better diagnostics.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
The researchers also found that
like in the case of the SARS
coronavirus, the spike protein
of the SARS-CoV-2 that causes
Coronavirus
Disease
19
(COVID-19)2 binds to the
cellular
receptor
called
angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE2), which serves as the
entry point into human cells.
But unlike in the case of SARS,
the spike protein of the novel
coronavirus binds to the cell
receptor with much higher
affinity — 10- to 20-fold
higher.

The much greater binding affinity to the cell receptor explains the
apparent high human-to-human transmissibility of the virus compared
with the SARS coronavirus.
</p>
</div>


<div>
<h2>Who is affected? </h2>
<p>
While people of all ages can be affected by the disease, people aged 80
and above are at the highest risk of dying due to COVID-19, according
to case records analysed by the Disease Control and Prevention Centers
in China and South Korea. Victims of the virus with pre-existing
medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes have a
higher fatality rate than others. Also the rate of fatalities was relatively
higher for retirees.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>What are the symptoms?</h2>
<p>
The guidelines 5 from the Union Health Ministry for early recognition
of COVID-19 patients are those who come in with Severe Acute
Respiratory Infection (SARI) who also have a history of foreign travel
or close contact with another COVID-19 patient.
As per the guidelines, “COVID–19 may present with mild, moderate,
or severe illness; the latter includes severe pneumonia, ARDS [Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome], sepsis and septic shock.”

<div>
<h2>How can it be detected?</h2>
<p>
The virus can be detected using a PCR test 6 . A PCR or polymerase
chain reaction test is DNA-based and can quickly tell if someone
harbours the virus. In India, the government facilities to test for the
virus include 52 labs belonging to the Viral Research and Diagnostic
Laboratories network of the Indian Council of Medical Research
(ICMR), 10 labs under the National Centre for Disease Control
(NCDC), and the NIV.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>What is the treatment?</h2>
<p>
There is no current evidence from randomised controlled trial to
recommend any specific treatment for suspected or confirmed COVID-
19 patients. No specific anti-virals are recommended for treatment of
those suffering from respiratory ailment due to lack of adequate
evidence from medical literature.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2>Can a vaccine be developed for COVID-19?</h2>
<p>
According to Raman. R. Gangakhedkar, head of the Epidemiology and
Communicable Diseases-I (ECD-I), Division of ICMR, there are two
ways of going for vaccine preparation — either you look at the
sequences of the gene which then may lead to development of
antibodies, or you actually have the strain and then you try to develop
a vaccine which is always an easier option. He said Indian scientists
have managed to successfully isolate the COVID-19 virus and about 11
isolates are available which is a prime requisite for doing any kind of
research related to viruses and developing the vaccine.
Internationally, several institutes and pharmaceutical companies are in
various stages of developing the vaccine with some set to go on clinical
trials soon .
