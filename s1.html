      <h2>Washing with soap</h2>
<p>
      The grime on our hands contains innumerable viruses and bacteria.
      Washing with water without using soap helps reduce the amount of
      microbes but does not remove most of the virus and bacteria
      completely. Using soap, therefore, becomes far more effective in
      removing microbes.
      Viruses such as coronavirus, influenza-causing viruses, Ebola, Zika
      have their genetic material encased in a layer of fat called the lipid
      envelope . Soap molecules are pin-shaped with a head that is water-
      loving (hydrophilic) and a tail that is oil-loving (oleophilic). Being
      oleophilic, the tail portion of the molecule tends to have an affinity for
      and ‘competes’ with the lipids in the virus envelope. Since the chemical
      bonds holding the virus together are not very strong, the long oleophilic
      tail gets inserted into the envelope and tends to have a ‘crowbar’ effect
      that breaks the lipid envelope of the virus. The tail also competes with the bond that binds the RNA and the lipid envelop thus dissolving the
      virus into its components which are then removed by water.</p>

    <h2>  Alcohol-based hand sanitisers </h2>
<p>
      Like soap, the alcohol present in hand sanitisers dissolve the lipid
      envelope, thus inactivating the virus. In addition, the alcohol also tends
      to change the shape or denature the mushroom-shaped protein
      structures that stick out of the lipid envelope. The mushroom-shaped
      protein structures help the virus to bind to special structures found on
      human cells and enter the cells. To be effective, the sanitisers should
      contain at least 60% alcohol .
      Unlike soap lather, the alcohol does not come in contact with all parts
      of the hand. So care needs to be taken to use sufficient sanitiser to
      increase the coverage. Unlike water, alcohol run does not remove the
      dead viruses from the hand. While a sanitiser can quickly reduce the
      number of microbes, it does not get rid of all types of germs, and is “not
      as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy”.

       <h2>Using a mask</h2>
<p>
      Medical masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus infection. If
      worn properly, masks may be effective in preventing transmission of
      coronavirus. An article published in the Journal of the American
      Medical Association (JAMA) says there is no evidence to suggest that
      masks worn by healthy individuals can help prevent infection.
      But a 2010 study says: “Mask wearing was associated with reduced
      secondary transmission and should be encouraged during outbreak
      situations.”
      Even the World Health Organization says wearing a medical mask is
      “one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain respiratory
      diseases, including novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in affected
      areas”.
      Transmission through droplets from coughing and sneezing is one of
      the major routes of virus spread. When worn correctly, a mask can
      reduce the risk of inhaling droplets containing the virus.
      With many studies showing that people infected with novel coronavirus
      transmit the virus even before symptoms show up, it may be prudent to
      wear a mask especially when the virus is spreading in the community.
      In a country like India, maintaining at least one metre distance can be
      a challenge, especially when there is no way of knowing who is infected
      till such time the person starts showing visible symptoms.

      <h2>Social distancing</h2>
<p>
      The WHO says that you should maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet)
      distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
      This is because when someone coughs or sneezes they spray small
      liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. “If
      you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
      COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease,” says the
      WHO.

      <h2>  Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</h2>
<p>
      Hands can pick up viruses as they come in contact with many surfaces.
      It can then transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,
      the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
      Practise respiratory hygiene.
      Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you
      cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
